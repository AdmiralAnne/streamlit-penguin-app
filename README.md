# üêß Streamlit Penguin Species Prediction App üêß

<i>Welcome to the **Penguin Species Prediction App**, a simple machine learning application built with Streamlit. It predicts the species of a penguin based on key physical features using a Random Forest Classifier. </i>

## A Better Description

The app utilizes a dataset containing penguin species and their characteristics ( named as penguins_cleaned.csv). Users(That's you!) can input features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, island, and sex. The model then predicts the species (Adelie, Gentoo, or Chinstrap) and provides the probabilities for each class. Preety cool right.. yeah.no.

## Some Features

- **Interactive Inputs:** select features through a sidebar interface.
- **Real-time Predictions:** The app provides immediate predictions and class probabilities.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes scatter plots to visualize the relationship between different features.. Yeah I got a little lazy on this part.
- **Expandable Sections:** Clean organization of raw data, features, labels, and encoded data. So you can see the magic of the code, without readin the code

## How to Use

1. **Open the App:** [Click theis link below to access the app](https://marji-penguin-app.streamlit.app/)
3. **Input Features:** Use the sidebar to select the penguin's features.
4. **View Predictions:** The app will display the predicted species and the probabilities for each species.

## Coming Soon

More features and improvements will be added.. when I get free time.
- Enhanced data visualizations
- Additional machine learning models for comparison
- In-depth explanations of the prediction process
- Drop your ideads as well have fun
